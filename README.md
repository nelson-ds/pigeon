# [PigeonMsg](http://pigeonmsg.com)
Trip planning service which leverages AI recommendations as well as human traveling experience

## What does this service do?
- Helps with planning your trip to a new city by combining the ease of texting, the power of AI and the bond of human connection :)
- Have generic questions? Ask the helpful `AI` - Pidge who'll gladly scour the internet and help answer your question!
- Have a more specific question AIs struggle to answer? No problem - we'll connect you to another `human` who can help!

## How does this service work?
1. Text the service and start the on-boarding process:
    - All interactions with this service will be via text message
    - This service utilizes an AI under the hood so you can chat with it about trip planning as you would with any chat-bot
    - This service exposes admin commands via keyword `pidge` if you want to bypass the AI, for example `pidge help`
    - Since this is a free service, it has rate limits for users and is currently restricted to planning trips only to cities in California
    
2. Leveraging AI for trip planning
    - Ask questions realted to planning a visit to a city and recive help from our friendly AI - pidge!

3. Leveraging human help for trip planning
    - Providing help: 
        - During on-boarding, you will be asked if you want to help other users on this platform in planning trips to cities you are familiar with (voluntary)
        - Answer questsions other users might have (after being connected anonymously) about visiting the places you are familiar with
    - Requesting help: 
        - For specific questions that AI cannot answer, get connected up with another user (anonymously) who is familar with that place and get help from them
    - Every connection to another human will be valid for a limited amount of time and a user can only be connected with one other user at any time
    - A users can chose to end their connection with another user at any time
